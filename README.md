 Week 4 Assignment
This repository has the unity package for the week 4 assignment.

When executed inside the editor, the user should be able
to type Q, W, E, R, T, or Y to navigate to a different,
aptly named primitive "exhibit". This is an exercise in
navigating arounda Unity project and making changes.
